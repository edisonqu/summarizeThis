## What is Summarize This?

Summarize This is a Discord bot that allows users to summarze any piece of information that they input into the prompt. This Bot is using the BART model, fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail. 

First Introduced in [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), and now released in [this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart). This model is being run on Hugging Face and their API. 

This bot is free for everyone and always will be.

## How does it work?

When a member uses a slash command to initiate the bot, they need to input a prompt. This prompt will be the information you pass onto the model in order to summarize. 

## Thank you Discord for giving out badges for developers again... <3
